# To-Do-App-Pro

## Before we start working on our code we write a testing using TDD so we make sure that every thing is working :blush:

### login.js:
We create 3 functions :addTodo, deleteTodo, markTodo; first we used cloneArrayOfObjects that create a copy of the todos array witch can't be changed

 we used cloneArrayOfObjects thats leave the input argument todos unchanged , then returns a new array, it should contain todos with the newTodo added to the end.
lastly we added an id to the newTodo used the generateId function to create an id.  

### dom.js:
First we added a span holding the description ,then we added the delete and the mark button and lastly we did css design.

We used addEventListener that allows us to run the delete and mark buttons.

It was very fun,interesting and challenging :sparkles::sparkles::star2:

We injoy working togather :sparkling_heart::heart_eyes:
